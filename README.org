 Project Switcher
    Manages your Matlab project paths dynamically and with ease
    Inspired by toolboxtoolbox

 example call:
           px
           (then return a number corresponding to a project)

 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. PLACE BELOW IN YOUR STARTUP FILE
          pxPath='/some/path/to/this/file'
          run(pxPath)
    2. SET THESE VARIABLES BELOW
       rootPrjDir
          Specifies a directory where all your projects will be
       rootTlbxDir
          Specifies a directory where toolboxes are located
          Toolboxes will always load with all projects, but projects given priority

    Optional variables:
       rootStbDir
          Specifies a directory where all your projects will be
       rootHookDir
          Specifies a directory where project hooks are located
          To create a hook, create a .m file with the same name as the project directory

          Hook can be script or function. If function, can px will return one of its outputs as 'out'

     Set per project dependencies
          In project directory create .px file
          d:projectName - development
          s:projectName - stable
          e:toolboxName - exclude a particular toolbox
          eAll:
