 Project Switcher
    Manages your Matlab project paths dynamically and with ease.

 example calls:
           px %(then return a number corresponding to a project)

           px(prjName) % to swith to project

           pxr % to reload current project 

 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. PLACE BELOW IN YOUR STARTUP FILE
          pxPath='/some/path/to/this/file';
          run(pxPath);
    2. SET UP CONFIG FILE 
          See _config_.example

 Directories
    "root"                The root directory for everything else below.  Specified in first line of config file.
    projects/             Root project directory where projects under development go.
    stableProjects/       Root project directory where stable projects go. 
    workspaces/           This is where a virtual isolated directory will be created for your project on load, with all dependencies. 
    stableWorkspaces/     Same as above, but for stable projects 
    toolboxes/            Anything in this directory will always be added to your path.
    localHooks/           Any matlab function in this directory with the same name as a project will run after Px finishes loading that project
